# Act0 color palette + modified tiles for Diablo 2

This repository provides the **Act0 color palette** and modified tilesets for **Diablo 2**, designed to work across all acts of the game without color shifting issues or graphical bugs.

## [Graphics preview (beta)](https://d2r-gimli.github.io/Diablo2_act0_color_palette/)


## Overview

- The original Diablo 2 game uses different **256-color palettes** for each act.
- The **Act0 color palette** included here contains only colors available in **all acts**, making it act-independent.
- While this reduces the total number of colors, any graphics saved with this palette will **work consistently across all acts**.

## What’s included

1. **Act0 color palette**
   - Works for all acts.
   - Prevents color shifting or graphical glitches.

2. **Modified original tilesets**
   - Tiles converted to the Act0 palette.

   - Includes `.ini` files with tile information and `.pcx` graphics files.

3. **Project Diablo 2 - Season 12 graphics**
   - Graphics from the current version of PD2 are included.
   - Only 2 tiles are **not** converted to Act0 and are marked with a file indicating which act palette should be used to avoid color loss.

## Usage

- Use the Act0 palette for **consistent graphics across all acts**.
- Tilesets can be imported directly into map editors or projects.
